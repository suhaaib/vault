# Agile Vs Waterfall

Areas:: [[Business Analytics]]

---

Agile and Waterfall are two distinct project management methodologies with different approaches and suitability for various projects:

### Agile Methodology:
- **Approach:** Agile involves frequent stakeholder interaction and adapts to changes during the project.
- **Flexibility:** High flexibility, allowing for adjustments and changes throughout the project.
- **Budget:** More flexible budget as changes can be accommodated.
- **Timeline:** Adaptable timeline based on project progress.
- **Client Involvement:** Requires close involvement of stakeholders throughout the project.

### Waterfall Methodology:
- **Approach:** Waterfall follows a linear system where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
- **Flexibility:** Less flexible compared to Agile, as changes are harder to implement once the project starts.
- **Budget:** Fixed budget due to the predetermined nature of the project.
- **Timeline:** Fixed timeline set from the beginning.
- **Client Involvement:** Less involvement of stakeholders compared to Agile.

When choosing between Agile and Waterfall, consider factors such as project requirements, stakeholder involvement, flexibility needed, and the ability to adapt to changes during the project development process.
