# Business Analyst Interview Prep



- Who are Stakeholders?

A stakeholder is an individual, group, or organization that has an interest in a company and can either affect or be affected by the business's operations and outcomes. Stakeholders can be internal, such as employees, owners, or investors, or external, like customers, suppliers, communities, governments, or trade associations. Their interests and involvement can influence the decisions and activities of a business, making their support crucial for the success of projects and the organization as a whole.
